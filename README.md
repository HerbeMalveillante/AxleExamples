# AxleExamples

An example project showcasing how to create applications with Axle

## Installation

As this project uses **Git Submodules** to load the Axle Engine, you should clone it with the following command :

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/HerbeMalveillante/AxleExamples.git
```

## Logisim

### GUI
1. We need to be able to move around a grid, zoom and unzoom using the trackpad.

2. We need to manage a complex UI layout with buttons, panels, and multiple controls

3. We need to manage a real-time gate simulation.
